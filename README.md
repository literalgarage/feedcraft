# Feedcraft

**WARNING**: This is extremely preliminary code. You should probably not use it for anything at the moment. But let me know if you are interested in helping out!

Feedcraft is a modern, typed, deeply tested RSS, ATOM, and JSON Feed parser and generator library for Python.

It offers multiple strictness modes, from very lenient to very strict, to suit your needs. It also offers a variety of options for customizing parsing and generation behavior.

As of this writing (late October 2025), Feedcraft is brand new and absolutely **not** ready for use of any kind.
